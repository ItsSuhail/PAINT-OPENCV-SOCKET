# PAINT-OPENCV-SOCKET
I've created a basic project. What it does is, First we run "srvMain.py" which will start the server, and then we'll run "clntMain.py" which will connect to the server and whatever we paint in the "Server" window it will be printed on "Client" window.

It is made with opencv & socket.

There are several functions:-
Right click- Board color will be set to your current color

Double right click- Board will be clear

Left click- Allows you to paint on board

* You also get a specific window to set your color

Here's a video example:-->

If you want to connect to your friends without paying anything, I suggest to use "ngrok" it can create ("TCP", "HTTP") tunnels for free
