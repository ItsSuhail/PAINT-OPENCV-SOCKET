# PAINT-OPENCV-SOCKET
I've created a basic project. What it does is, First we run "srvMain.py" which will start the server, and then we'll run "clntMain.py" which will connect to the server and whatever we paint in the "Server" window it will be printed on "Client" window.

It is made with opencv & socket.

There are several functions:-
Right click- Board color will be set to your current color
Double right click- Board will be clear
Left click- Allows you to paint on board

Here's a video example:-->
